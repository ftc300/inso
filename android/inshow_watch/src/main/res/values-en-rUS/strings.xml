        right to sublicense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.2. The User can install, use, display and run the Software on a single mobile terminal device for non-commercial
        purposes. However, the User shall not install, use or run the Software for commercial operation purposes. The User
        shall not copy, alter or modify any data of the Software, or any data released to the memory of any terminal device
        during the running of the Software and the interactive data generated between the client and the server during the
        running of the Software, or run the Software with plug-ins, or create any derivative work in any form, including but
        not limited to plug-ins, access to the Software and related systems through unauthorized third-party tools/services.
        If you need to sell, copy or distribute the Software commercially, e.g. software pre-installation and bundling, you
        must obtain the written authorization and license from Inso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.3. Without the permission of Inso, the User shall not install the Software on other terminal devices that are not

        problems, device problems or damages resulting from mismatch between the Software version and the device model shall
        be solely assumed by the User.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.3. In order to improve User experience and optimize service content, Inso reserves the right to provide replaced,
        modified and upgraded version of the Software, and also reserves the right to charge for such replacement,
        modification or upgrading, but will obtain your consent in advance for such charges. The Software will enable &quot;upgrade

&lt;p&gt;We may share anonymised information and statistics in aggregate form with third parties for business purposes, for

        number of customers in certain demographic groups who purchased certain products or who carried out certain
        transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the avoidance of doubt, Inso may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent if it is
        and only to the extent it is allowed explicitly under local data protection laws. Such disclosure may be brought
        about by the necessity to protect our rights, ensure the safety of you and other people, and comply with the
        requirements of the local government to facilitate the investigations of illegal activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SECURITY SAFEGUARDS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INSO’S SECURITY MEASURES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to ensuring that your personal information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access,
        disclosure or other similar risks, we have put in place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to
        safeguard and secure the information we collect from your using of Inso products and services and on Inso websites.
        We will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard your personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when you access your Mi Account, you can choose to use our two-step verification process for better
        security. When you send or receive data from your Inso device to our servers, we make sure they are encrypted using
        Secure Sockets Layer (&quot;SSL&quot;) and other algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All your personal information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. We classify
        your data based on importance and sensitivity, and ensure that your personal information has the highest security
        level. We make sure that our employees and Third Party Service Providers who access the information to help provide
        you with our products and services are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be
        disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet such obligations. We have special access controls for cloud-based
        data storage as well. All in all, we regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices,
        including physical security measures, to guard against any unauthorised access and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will take all practicable steps to safeguard your personal information. However, you should be aware that the use
        of the Internet is not entirely secure, and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any
        personal information which is transferred from you or to you via the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT YOU CAN DO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can play your part in safeguarding your personal information by not disclosing your login password or
        account information to anybody unless such person is duly authorised by you. Whenever you log in as a Mi Account
        user on Inso websites, particularly on somebody else\'s computer or on public Internet terminals, you should
        always log out at the end of your session.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inso cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by third party accesses to your personal
        information as a result of your failure to keep your personal information private. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, you must notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other Internet
        user or any other breach of security.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your personal information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RETENTION POLICY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal information will be held for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, or
        as required or permitted by applicable laws. We shall cease to retain personal information, or remove the means by
        which the personal information can be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable to assume
        that the purpose for which that personal information was collected is no longer being served by retention of the
        personal information, including the cases when the personal information is no longer required for resolving legal
        disputes, applying our Agreements, or achieving our business goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the personal information on the device (except for the current time and current number of steps as showed on the
        device) will be erased when you hard reset your device. To implement a hard-reset function, you can withdraw your
        consent in Mi Home app, then press the watch button for 12s to reset the watch. (Note that the watch will not
        therefore stop working.) Beware that hard-reset can’t be undone, so you have to make sure that you don’t need the
        information any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACCESSING OTHER FEATURES ON YOUR DEVICE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our applications may need access to certain features on your device such as Wi-Fi network status This information is
        used to allow the applications to run on your device and allow you to interact with the applications. At any time
        you may revoke your permissions by turning these off at the device level or contacting us at
        privacy@inshowlife.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER YOUR INFORMATION!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONTROLLING SETTINGS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inso recognises that privacy concerns differ from person to person. Therefore, we provide examples of ways Inso makes
        available for you to choose to restrict the collection, use, disclosure or processing of your personal information
        and control your privacy settings: for example, log in and out of the Mi Account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for the abovementioned purposes, you may change
        your mind at any time by writing or emailing us at privacy@inshowlife.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACCESS, UPDATING, CORRECTING OR ERASURE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have the right to request access to and/or correction of any other personal information that we hold about
        you. When you update your personal information, you will be asked to verify your identity before we proceed with
        your request. Once we obtain sufficient information to accommodate your request for access to or correction of
        your personal information, we shall proceed to respond to your request within any timeframe set out under your
        applicable data protection laws.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We normally provide such services for free but reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee for your data access
        request.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you would like to request access to your personal data held by us or if you believe any information we are
        holding on you is incorrect or incomplete or if you believe any information we are holding on you is
        inappropriate or excessive, please write to or email us as soon as possible at the email address below. Email:
        privacy@inshowlife.com.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For details relating to the personal information in your Mi Account, you may also access and change them at
        http://account.mi.com or by logging into your account on your device.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may withdraw your consent for the collection, use and/or disclosure of your personal information in our
        possession or control by submitting a request. This may be done by clicking “User Agreement and Privacy Policy”
        in the “General settings” menu of Mi Home app or sending e-mail to privacy@inshowlife.com. We will process your
        request within a reasonable time from when the request was made, and thereafter not collect, use and/or disclose
        your personal information as per your request.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please recognise that your withdrawal of consent could result in certain legal consequences. Depending on the
        extent of your withdrawal of consent for us to process your personal information, it may mean that you will not
        be able to enjoy Inso’s products and services.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF YOUR JURISDICTION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent that we may need to transfer personal information outside of your jurisdiction, whether to our
        affiliated companies (which are in the communications, social media, technology and cloud businesses) or Third Party
        Service Providers, we shall do so in accordance with the applicable laws. In particular, we will ensure that all
        transfers will be in accordance with requirements under your applicable local data protection laws by putting in
        place appropriate safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inso may use overseas facilities operated and controlled by Inso to process or back up your personal information.
        Currently, Inso has data centres in Beijing and Singapore. These overseas jurisdictions may or may not have in place
        data protection laws which are substantially similar to that in your home jurisdiction. We may transfer to and store
        your personal information at our overseas facilities. However, this does not change any of our commitments to
        safeguard your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MISCELLANEOUS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MINORS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider it the responsibility of parents to monitor their children’s use of our products and services.
        Nevertheless, it is our policy not to require personal information from minors or offer to send any promotional
        materials to persons in that category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inso does not seek or intend to seek to receive any personal information from minors. Should a parent or guardian
        have reasons to believe that a minor has provided Inso with personal information without their prior consent, please
        contact us to ensure that the personal information is removed and the minor unsubscribes from any of the applicable
        Inso services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ORDER OF PRECEDENCE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have agreed to our applicable User Agreements, in the event of inconsistency between such User Agreements and
        this Privacy Policy, such User Agreements shall prevail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We keep our Privacy Policy under regular review and may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our
        information practices. If we make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email (sent to the
        e-mail address specified in your account) or post the changes on all the Inso websites or through our software, so
        that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it. Such changes to our Privacy Policy shall
        apply from the effective date as set out in the notice or on the website. We encourage you to periodically review
        this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of products and services on the
        websites, mobile phones and/or any other device will be taken as acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy. We will
        seek your fresh consent before we collect more personal information from you or when we wish to use or disclose your
        personal information for new purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DO I HAVE TO AGREE TO ANY THIRD PARTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Privacy Policy does not apply to products and services offered by a third party. Inso products and services may
        include third parties’ products, services and links to third parties’ websites. When you use such products or
        services, they may collect your information too. For this reason, we strongly suggest that you read the third
        party’s privacy policy as you have taken time to read ours. We are not responsible for and cannot control how third
        parties use personal information which they collect from you. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to other sites
        linked from our services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOCIAL MEDIA (FEATURES) AND WIDGETS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our websites include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this
        button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you
        are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social media features and
        Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. Your interactions with these Features
        are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SINGLE SIGN-ON&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your jurisdiction, you may be able to log in to our website using sign-on services such as Facebook
        Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity, provide you the option to share
        certain personal information (such as your name and email address) with us, and to pre-populate our sign up form.
        Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this website to your
